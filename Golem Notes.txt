Sky golem legs do not move and she uses vex animations [weapon hand raises when she charges]
-holds a sword in hand
Ocean golem tail doesn't need an animation [but a light waving would be fine]
-holds a trident in hand 
[weapons are twice the size of player handheld items]

Core golem:
"I've decided to do a small remodel of the core god to make him more interesting"
- he will take damage from anything instead of just pickaxes.
- but I'm giving him an extra set of arms
- and a new ability when he reaches 1/3 health, he raises into the air and sprouts 4 more arms. Those arms shoots fireballs alongside his head in stage 2

the ocean/sky golem should return to their summon point if you die, if not they persist with a follow range of 2 chunks
all the others would have a 2 chunk range as well, returning to their summon point when you die

Golem HP should slowly return as well rather than insta-refill
