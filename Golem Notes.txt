All Golems:
+ Go dormant when you die and return to the tower top but instead of fully healing, they slowly regenerate health
+ the golems when freed from the monolith can chase the player at a max range of 2 chunks, otherwise they teleport back
+ if they go dormant when a player dies, then you will need to go within a 6 blocks or less radius to reawaken it

========================================================================

Land Golem
HP: 300 Hearts

Attacks:
-Fireball
-Melee punch

Apocalypse stomp 
-when above the player: 
-the golem will smash the floor by performing a standing still jump on the spot]

When below 1/3 HP
-Golem becomes enraged, doubling his firing speed but losing half his defenses

Ideas:
+ Fireballs explode in the air without hitting a block after a certain time like Anti-Air

========================================================================

Sky golem:
+ legs do not move and she uses vex animations [weapon hand raises when she charges]
-holds a sword in hand
Ocean golem tail doesn't need an animation [but a light waving would be fine]
-holds a trident in hand 
[weapons are twice the size of player handheld items]
+ What to do with the Minions when she's dormant?

Minions:
+ the sky golem summons sky minions [player models with wings, i forgot to add the wings to the model]
+ every 1/4 hp she loses, a cloud of 4-7 of her minions spawn

========================================================================

Core golem:
"I've decided to do a small remodel of the core god to make him more interesting"
- he will take damage from anything instead of just pickaxes.
- but I'm giving him an extra set of arms
- and a new ability when he reaches 1/3 health, he raises into the air and sprouts 4 more arms. Those arms shoots fireballs alongside his head in stage 2

the ocean/sky golem should return to their summon point if you die, if not they persist with a follow range of 2 chunks
all the others would have a 2 chunk range as well, returning to their summon point when you die

Golem HP should slowly return as well rather than insta-refill
