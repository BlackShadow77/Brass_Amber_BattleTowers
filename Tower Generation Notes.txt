Floor Structure:
name_towertype_spawners

Bottom Floor 1 -> Cult Room even 1-2 -> Odd Floor 1-2 -> Even Floor 1-2 -> Cult Room odd 1-3 -> Even Floor 1-3 -> Odd Floor 1-3 -> Mini Boss 1-4

Land_Default_246 = Cult Room even 1-2, , Barracks Even 1-2, Barracks Even 1-3, MiniBoss 1-4
Land_Default_357 =  Cult Room odd-3, Barracks Odd -2, Barracks Odd -3

DONE ^ (mini boss needs to be rotated -and actually made)

Cult Room Odd 1-3 will have a jigsaw that skips up to the mini-boss floor so that the jigsaw limit isn't reached.




Bottom Floor 2 -> Even Floor 2-2 -> Cult Room odd 2-2 -> Even Floor 2-2 -> Odd Floor 2-3 -> Cult Room even 2-3 -> Odd Floor 2-3 -> Mini Boss 2-4

Land_Default_246_2 = Cult Room even-3, Barracks Even 2-2, MiniBoss 2-4
Land_Default_357_2 = Cult Room odd2-2, Barracks Odd 2-3




Biome Specific stuff - Tower generates from the bottom floor up so, very long-term plan is to have a seperate .json pool that 
		includes, for example, icy weathered floor variations 

	Land_Default = No weathering    ---  8-10 Spacing
	Land_Icy = Icy
	Land_Desert = Sandy
	Land_Forest = Overgrown
	Land_Mountain = deteriorating 

	Ocean_Default  --- 10-12 Spacing

	Nether_Default --- 14-16 Spacing
	Nether_Overgrown

	Core_Default  --- 12-14 Spacing
	Core_Flooded

	End_Default  --- 18-20 Spacing
	End_Overgrown
	End_Deteriorating

	Sky_Default  --- 20-24 Spacing
	Sky_Airy = No Iron Bars on windows, all 4 walls are windows
