Biome Specific stuff - Tower generates from the bottom floor up so, very long-term plan is to have a seperate .json pool that 
		includes, for example, icy weathered floor variations 

	Land_Default = No weathering
	Land_Icy = Icy
	Land_Desert = Sandy
	Land_Forest = Overgrown
	Land_Mountain = deteriorating 

	Ocean_Default

	Nether_Default
	Nether_Overgrown

	Core_Default
	Core_Flooded

	End_Default
	End_Overgrown
	End_Deteriorating

	Sky_Default
	floor 8- skeleton, silver skeleton, spectral wraith, sky minion
    floor 7- skeleton, silver skeleton, spectral wraith, sky minion
    floor 6- skeleton, silver skeleton, spectral wraith, sky minion
    floor 5- skeleton, silver skeleton, spectral wraith
    floor 4- skeleton, silver skeleton
    floor 2- skeleton, silver skeleton
    floor 1- skeleton, silver skeleton
	Sky_Airy = No Iron Bars on windows, all 4 walls are windows
